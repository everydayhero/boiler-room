**From October 1-31**, participants run their own neighborhoods track their miles using fitness tracking apps like [Strava](https://strava.com) or [Map My Fitness](http://www.mapmyfitness.com/) during the month long virtual challenge.

Runners can choose a featured charity or choose the cause thatâ€™s closest to their heart. Individuals seek support from friends or family to collectively raise $1,500,000 for charity.

**Although worlds apart, we are in this together. Virtually, anything is possible.**
